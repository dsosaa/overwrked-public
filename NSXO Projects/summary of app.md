App Summary: Telegram Bot for Paid Messaging
I’ve built a Telegram bot that lets creators monetize 1-on-1 conversations with their fans. Here’s how it works:
    •    Easy Setup: Creators set up the bot to offer paid messaging services right inside Telegram.
    •    Seamless Experience for Fans: Fans open the bot, get a welcome message, a quick tutorial, and a few free credits to start chatting.
    •    Unique Conversation Threads: When a fan sends a message, the bot routes it to a private Telegram group, creating a dedicated thread for each fan. Creators or admins can reply in these threads, and the responses are sent back to the fan, making it feel like a live, private chat.
    •    Credit-Based Monetization: Each message costs 1 credit. Fans can check their balance, buy more credits using Stripe, and receive reminders when their credits run low. There are also special packages and daily unlimited plans for power users.
    •    User-Friendly Commands: Fans interact with the bot using simple commands like /start, /balance, /buy, /help, and /status. The bot offers tutorials, balance views, and usage analytics to keep things engaging and transparent.
    •    Robust Error Handling: The bot is designed to handle errors smoothly and ensure a reliable user experience.
Think of it as a Telegram-based paid chat platform—great for creators who want to offer exclusive, monetized conversations, including NSFW or sexting-style interactions.
