Of course. Here are several diagrams that visually represent the key components and workflows of your enterprise-grade Telegram bot project.

---

### **1. High-Level System Architecture**

This diagram provides a bird's-eye view of your entire system. It shows how the end-user on Telegram, your bot application hosted on Railway, the PostgreSQL database, and the Stripe API all interact. The bot application is the central orchestrator.


```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Cloud Services"
        U[üë§ User on Telegram App]
        S[üí≥ Stripe API]
        T[üåê Telegram API]
    end

    subgraph "Hosting Platform (e.g., Railway)"
        B(ü§ñ Bot Application<br>Python / Webhook Server)
        DB[(üóÑÔ∏è PostgreSQL Database)]
        C(‚öôÔ∏è Cache Layer)
    end

    U -- Interacts with --> T
    T -- Webhook (User Message) --> B
    B -- API Call (Send Reply) --> T
    B <--> DB
    B <--> C
    B -- API Call (Create Checkout) --> S
    S -- Webhook (Payment Status) --> B
```

### **2. User Onboarding and Purchase Flow**

This flowchart illustrates the journey a **new user** takes from first interacting with the bot to successfully purchasing credits and sending their first message.


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User sends /start to the Bot] --> B{Welcome Message}
    B --> C[User clicks '‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start' button]
    C --> D[Bot displays available product packages]
    D --> E{User selects a product}
    E --> F[Bot generates and sends a Stripe Checkout link]
    F --> G[User completes payment on Stripe]
    G --> H(Stripe sends 'checkout.session.completed' webhook)
    H --> I[Bot's Webhook Server validates event]
    I --> J[Bot updates user's credits in Database]
    J --> K[Bot sends confirmation message to User]
    K --> L[User can now send messages]
```



### **3. Topic-Based Conversation Management Flow**

This is the core of your admin experience. This diagram shows the two-way communication bridge between a user's private chat and their dedicated thread in the admin group.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as üë§ User (Private Chat)
    participant B as ü§ñ Bot Logic
    participant A as üßë‚Äçüíº Admin (Admin Group Topic)

    U->>B: Sends a message ("Hello!")
    B->>B: Check if user has a topic in DB
    Note over B: No topic found. Create one.
    B->>A: Creates new Topic: "üë§ username (12345)"
    B->>A: Pins User Info Card to the new topic
    B->>A: Forwards User's message ("Hello!") to topic

    A->>B: Admin replies inside the topic ("Hi there!")
    B->>B: Get user_id associated with this topic_id from DB
    B->>U: Forwards Admin's reply ("Hi there!") to User
    A-->>A: Bot reacts with ‚úÖ to Admin's message
```



### **4. Git Branching Strategy (GitFlow-Inspired)**

This diagram visualizes the branching model outlined in your documentation, ensuring organized and safe development. `main` is for production, `development` is for integration, and `feature` branches are for new work.
Here is your **Git Branching Strategy (GitFlow-Inspired)** diagram as a Mermaid `gitGraph`, ready to paste into your Obsidian note:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial Commit"
    branch development
    checkout development
    commit id: "Setup dev env"
    branch feature/new-admin-panel
    checkout feature/new-admin-panel
    commit id: "feat: Build UI"
    commit id: "feat: Add logic"
    checkout development
    merge feature/new-admin-panel id: "Merge Admin Panel"
    checkout main
    merge development id: "Release v1.0" tag: "v1.0"
    checkout development
    commit id: "dev work..."

    checkout main
    branch hotfix/payment-bug
    checkout hotfix/payment-bug
    commit id: "fix: Critical payment bug"
    checkout main
    merge hotfix/payment-bug
    checkout development
    merge hotfix/payment-bug
```



### **5. Database Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

This ERD visually represents your PostgreSQL schema. It shows the tables and the relationships between them, such as how a `user` can have a `conversation` record and multiple `transactions`.

Here is your **Database Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** in Mermaid format, ready to use in your Obsidian note:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users {
        BIGINT telegram_id PK
        VARCHAR username
        INT message_credits
        INT time_credits_seconds
        VARCHAR tier
        BOOLEAN is_banned
        BOOLEAN auto_recharge_enabled
        VARCHAR stripe_customer_id
    }
    products {
        SERIAL id PK
        VARCHAR label
        VARCHAR stripe_price_id UK
        VARCHAR item_type
        INT amount
        BOOLEAN is_active
    }
    conversations {
        BIGINT user_id PK, FK
        INT topic_id UK
        TIMESTAMP last_message_at
        BOOLEAN is_pinned
        TEXT notes
    }
    transactions {
        SERIAL id PK
        BIGINT user_id FK
        VARCHAR stripe_charge_id
        INT amount_paid_usd_cents
        TIMESTAMP created_at
    }

    users ||--o{ transactions : "has"
    users ||--|| conversations : "has one"
```
