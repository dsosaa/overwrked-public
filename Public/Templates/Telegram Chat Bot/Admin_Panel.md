# Admin Panel

Of course. Based on the robust setup with a dynamic database, here are several other powerful and helpful features you could add to your admin settings panel. These are designed to give you full control over your bot's operation, user management, and sales without ever touching the code.

They are organized from core business functions to advanced operational controls.

---

### ### üõçÔ∏è 1. Product & Sales Management

This is the most critical addition. It allows you to manage what you sell directly from Telegram.

#### **Manage Products Directly**

- **Why:** Your current products are hardcoded in the database. If you want to run a weekend special or change a price, you have to do it manually in the database. This feature brings full control into your admin panel.
    
- **How:** Add a "üõçÔ∏è Manage Products" button to your `/settings` menu. This would start a new `ConversationHandler` with the following options:
    
    - **Add Product:** A guided process where the bot asks you for the `Label` (e.g., "$15 for 50 Messages"), the `Stripe Price ID` (which you create in your Stripe dashboard), the `Item Type` ('credits' or 'time'), and the `Amount` (number of credits or minutes).
        
    - **Edit Product:** Shows a list of your current products as buttons. You pick one, and the bot asks which attribute you want to change (e.g., "Edit Label").
        
    - **Activate/Deactivate Product:** Shows your list of products. Tapping a product would toggle its `is_active` status in the database. This is perfect for hiding seasonal offers or temporarily removing a package without deleting it.

### ### üë• 2. User Management & Moderation

These features are essential for customer support and for handling specific user situations.

#### **User Lookup & Manual Adjustments**

- **Why:** A fan might report an issue, or you may want to reward a loyal user. You need a way to view their status and manually adjust their credits without database access.
    
- **How:** Create a new admin command, `/user <telegram_id>`.
    
    1. The bot responds with a summary of that user: their current credit balance, time balance, and maybe a list of their last 3 purchases (requires a `transactions` table).
        
    2. Beneath this summary, the bot provides buttons like "‚ûï Add Credits," "‚ûñ Remove Credits," or " BAN USER".
        
    3. Clicking "‚ûï Add Credits" would trigger a `ConversationHandler` that asks "How many credits would you like to add?". After you enter a number, it updates the user's balance in the database.
        

#### **View Banned Users**

- **Why:** To easily keep track of and manage users you've had to ban from the service.
    
- **How:** Add an `is_banned BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` column to your `users` table. The `/user` command above would include a "Ban" button. In your `/settings` panel, you could have a "üö´ View Banned Users" button that lists all banned users and gives you an option to "Unban" them. Your `master_message_handler` would need to check this flag before processing any message.

### ### ü§ñ 3. Bot Operations & Communication

These features control the bot's status and allow you to communicate with your entire user base.

#### **Broadcast Message**

- **Why:** To announce new offers, upcoming vacation time, or new content to all of your paying customers at once. This is a crucial marketing tool.
    
- **How:** Create a `/broadcast` command.
    
    1. The bot asks, "Who should receive this message?" with options like "All Users" or "Paying Users Only" (users with `message_credits > 0` or a transaction history).
        
    2. The bot then asks, "Please type the message you want to broadcast."
        
    3. After you send the message, the bot shows you a preview and an "Are you sure? YES/NO" confirmation.
        
    4. Upon confirmation, the bot queries the database for the target user list and iterates through it, sending the message to each user. **Important:** It should send messages slowly (e.g., with a `time.sleep(0.5)` between each one) to avoid hitting Telegram's rate limits.
        

#### **"Maintenance Mode" Toggle**

- **Why:** If something breaks (e.g., Stripe payments are failing), you need a "panic button" to stop users from making purchases or sending messages while you fix it.
    
- **How:** Add a "üîß Maintenance Mode: OFF" button to your `/settings`.
    
    - Clicking it toggles a `maintenance_mode` value in your `bot_settings` table between 'ON' and 'OFF'.
        
    - Your `start` and `master_message_handler` functions must first check this setting. If it's 'ON', they should ignore the normal logic and instead reply with a configurable message like, "The service is temporarily down for maintenance. Please check back shortly."

### ### üìä 4. Analytics & Reporting

Get quick business insights without needing a full web dashboard.

#### **Quick Stats Report**

- **Why:** To quickly check the health of your service directly from your phone.
    
- **How:** Add a "üìä Quick Stats" button in `/settings`. When tapped, the bot runs a few database queries and sends you a summary message:
    
    - **Total Users:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;`
        
    - **Paying Customers:** (Requires a `transactions` table) `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM transactions;`
        
    - **Revenue (Last 30 Days):** (Requires a `transactions` table with a timestamp and amount)
        
    - **Most Popular Product:** A query that counts which `product_id` appears most often in your transaction history.
