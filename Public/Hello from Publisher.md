# Hello from GitHub Publisher

This is a sample public note. To publish it:

1. Open the Command Palette in Obsidian.
2. Run "GitHub Publisher: Share".
3. The note will be uploaded to your configured repository and branch.

If you prefer publishing only notes inside the `Public/` folder, set that in the plugin settings.
