# 🛠️ Make.md Editor UX Quickstart

Follow these steps to enable and use the key editor upgrades from Make.md.

## 1️⃣ Enable the Features
1) Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → Browse → install and enable “Make.md”.
2) Settings → Make.md:
- Slash menu: On
- Floating editor toolbar: On
- Inline properties: On
- Properties panel at top: On
- Page icons: On (optional)
- Link cards: On (optional)

Note: If the Slash menu does not open, disable Restricted mode under Community plugins and retry.

## 2️⃣ Use the Slash Menu
- In any note, type "/" to open the menu; type to search, Enter to apply.
- Common inserts: headings, lists, callouts, code blocks, tables, templates.

## 3️⃣ Floating Editor Toolbar
- Select text to show the toolbar (formatting, lists, checkboxes, code, quote, highlight, etc.).
- Works in both reading and editing modes depending on theme/settings.

## 4️⃣ Quick Transforms (Selection → Block)
Select one or more lines, then run the commands below. Add hotkeys for speed.
- Make: Convert selection → Callout  (suggested hotkey: Cmd+Alt+C)
- Make: Convert selection → Card     (suggested hotkey: Cmd+Alt+K)
- Make: Convert selection → Toggle   (suggested hotkey: Cmd+Alt+T)

How to bind hotkeys: Settings → Hotkeys → search for “Make: Convert selection” → assign.

## 5️⃣ Inline Properties and Panel
- With Inline properties enabled, key properties (e.g., `status`, `priority`, `due`) are editable at the top of the note.
- Add a hotkey for “Make: Toggle properties panel” (suggestion: Cmd+Shift+P) to show/hide quickly.

## 6️⃣ Page Icons and Covers (Optional)
- Click the icon next to the title to set an emoji/icon. Covers can be enabled via Make.md settings.
- Icons and link cards make lists, boards, and references easier to scan.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices
- Keep standard properties: `type`, `status`, `priority`, `due`, `owner`, `updated`.
- Use the Slash menu for all structural blocks; use quick transforms for fast refactoring.
- If a theme hides the floating toolbar, try Minimal or AnuPpuccin and enable Style Settings.

Open the Command Palette (Cmd+P) and type "Make:" to discover all available commands.
